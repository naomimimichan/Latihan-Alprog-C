**<p> Hello! </p>** 
<p> This folder contains every unfinished and finished experiments throughout my journey as an Informatics Engineering student. </p>
My motto is: "Always add readable and suitable sprinkles to every practice-code you make!" (As practice-codes are not supposed to make you hate coding, but it's supposed to make you fall in love with coding).
